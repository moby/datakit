# Weekly DataKit dev report for 2017-05-29 to 2017-06-04 (week 22)

This report covers weekly developments in the [datakit] [irmin] [git] [9p] repositories.

This week saw a significant simplication in the GitHub bridge is deployed, as it can now run without a server and use a local Git repository directly ([datakit#577] [@talex5] [@samoht]).  This in turn simplifies the deployment of DataKit as part of various CI services use it now, such as the [LinuxKit](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit) Moby project.

The GitHub bridge also adds an an `owner` file to identify the PR creator, which can be used by DataKitCI plugins ([datakit#587] [@samoht]).

For those getting started with DataKit and Irmin, [@nickbetteridge] started an issue on how to get started ([irmin#450]).
Our GSoC intern [@dudelson] is also active on [irmin#415] about the HTTP REST API ([@dbuenzli] [@dudelson] [@samoht]).

As part of the move to standardise interfaces across Moby components, there is working on adding building GRPC and CaPnP RPC libraries so that DataKit can make use of these. Check in with [@talex5] if you are interested in contributing.

Releases are now being cut with this functionality, starting with [git:1.11.0].
